## ✨ Features

Momo originates from Xiaohongshu📕, serving as the default nickname for every new user—symbolizing a fresh start. This philosophy guides our blog design, striking a balance between complex functionality and minimalist aesthetics.

* **Minimalist Design**: Clean page layout with black and white as primary colors, accented by blue
* **Dark Mode**: Supports manual switching or automatic system adaptation
* **Article Search**: Implements localized search using [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: Supports multilingual switching, currently available in Simplified Chinese and English
* **Mobile Adaptation**: Components optimized for mobile devices, delivering the same experience as desktop browsers
* **Commenting**: Supports local deployment and Cloudflare deployment. See [Backend](https://github.com/Motues/Momo-Backend) for details
* **Extensive Markdown syntax**: Supports Katex, Typst, and Alert components, GitHub cards, custom syntax, and more
* Other core features: Article categories, directory, RSS subscription, text statistics, reading time
